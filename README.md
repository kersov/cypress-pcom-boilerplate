# Cypress PCOM Boilerplate

## Overview
This repository serves as a foundational Cypress boilerplate project designed to streamline the process of writing end-to-end (E2E) tests. By leveraging the Page Component Object Model (PCOM), this boilerplate provides a structured and scalable approach to test automation.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Environment Testing**: Easily configure and run tests across multiple environments.
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Support for testing on various devices to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.
- **Multi-Language Applications**: Built-in support for testing applications with multiple languages.
- **Test Tagging**: Organize and execute tests efficiently using tags.

## Getting Started
To get started with this boilerplate, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation.

## Base Components

The boilerplate provides a set of reusable base component classes to model and interact with UI elements in a structured way:

- **BasicComponent**: The foundational class for all components. Handles selectors, nested components, and basic actions like click and doubleClick.
- **InteractiveComponent**: Extends BasicComponent with methods for enabling/disabling components and assertions for enabled/disabled state and value.
- **TypeableComponent**: Extends InteractiveComponent, adding methods for typing, clearing, and value/length assertionsâ€”ideal for inputs and text areas.
- **Input**: Extends TypeableComponent. Adds methods for checking/unchecking/toggling checkboxes, asserting input types, and checking checked state.
- **Button**: Extends InteractiveComponent. Represents button elements (custom functionality can be added as needed).
- **Checkbox**: Extends Input. Represents checkbox inputs (inherits all Input methods).
- **Select**: Extends Input. Adds methods for selecting options and asserting available options in dropdowns.
- **TextArea**: Extends TypeableComponent. Represents multi-line text input areas.

### Usage Examples

```js
// Example: Using Input component
const Input = require('./cypress/components/base/Input');
const usernameInput = new Input('username', '#username');
usernameInput.type('testuser').shouldHaveValue('testuser');

// Example: Using Button component
const Button = require('./cypress/components/base/Button');
const submitButton = new Button('submit', '#submit');
submitButton.click();

// Example: Using Select component
const Select = require('./cypress/components/base/Select');
const countrySelect = new Select('country', '#country');
countrySelect.selectOption('US').shouldHaveOption('United States');
```
